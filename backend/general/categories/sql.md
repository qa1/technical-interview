# SQL

* Primary-key constraint
  * Enforces the uniqueness of rows and also disallows NULLs in the constraint attributes
  * To enforce the uniqueness of the logical primary-key constraint, SQL Server will create
      a unique index behind the scenes. A unique index is a physical mechanism used by
      SQL Server to enforce uniqueness
