    * What is a race condition?
    * Why is it important?
    * What are different types of race conditions?
    * When do race conditions occur?
    * How we can prevent it?
* Synchronization
    * What is memory synchronization?
    * What problem does it solve?
    * How we can achieve it?
    * What benefits and drawbacks does it provide?
    * When we should use it?
* Deadlocks, Livelocks, Starvation
    * What is it?
    * When does it occurs?
    * How we can prevent it?
    * What is dining philosophers' problem?
* Transactions
    * What is a transaction?
    * What problem does it solves?
    * How does it affects the application?
    * What is atomicity and how we can achieve it?
    * What is isolation and how we can achieve it?
    * What are different isolation levels?
* Goroutine
    * Definition
    * What is goroutine?
    * How is it different with Thread/Process/Coroutine/Green Thread?
    * Goroutine Leak
    * What is a goroutine leak and how we can prevent it?
    * Why is it important?
    * Race Detection
    * How we can detect it before runtime?
    * Is there any way to detect race conditions on runtime?
    * How reliable is it?
    * Do you know how Goroutine scheduler works?
* Channels
    * What is a channel and why do we use it?
    * There is a proverb ["Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating"](http://go-proverbs.github.io). What does it mean?
    * What is the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels? and when we use either of them?
    * How do read-only/write-only channels help us?
* sync package
    * What is the use case of sync packages and types?
    * What is the use case of each type in this package?
* Patterns
    * Async
    * We don't have async keywords in golang like some other languages. How can we achieve the same behavior in Go?
    * Why and where do we need to use this pattern?
    * Queue
    * How can we create a queue in golang?
    * How can we add rate limiting and policy to the queue?
    * Does changing sync and sequential process into an async one with queue really help scalability? Why?
    * How do queues change application behavior?
    * Why and where do we need to use this pattern?
    * Pipelines
    * What is a pipeline?
    * What are the different ways to implement it?
    * Why and where do we need to use this pattern?
    * Fan-In and Fan-Out
    * What is Fan-In/Fan-Out?
    * How we can implement it?
    * Why and where do we need to use this pattern?
    * Heartbeats
    * What are Heartbeats?
    * How we can implement it?
    * How it can help us? What benefits and drawbacks does it have?
    * Why and where do we need to use this pattern?
    * Timeouts and Cancellation
    * Can you describe a scenario where you need to cancel/timeout a Goroutine?
    * How we can handle timeouts and cancellations of Goroutines?
    * How it can affect application behavior? What do we need to consider?
    * Error propagation
    * How we should propagate errors between Goroutines?
    * What happens when we want structured errors?
    * Work stealing
    * What is work stealing?
    * How can we implement it?
    * How can it help us?
    * Where should we use this?
